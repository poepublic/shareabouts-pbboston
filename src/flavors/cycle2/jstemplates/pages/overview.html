  <h2>{{#_}}Welcome to Ideas in Action!{{/_}}</h2>

  <p>{{#_}}<strong>Ideas in Action</strong> is Boston’s Participatory Budgeting
  (PB) initiative, where residents can decide how to spend a part of the City’s
  budget. By engaging in Ideas in Action, Bostonians of all ages and backgrounds
  can:
    <ol>
      <li>Share project ideas that help advance social and racial equity;</li>
      <li>Decide on the top projects that will appear on the PB Ballot for voting; and,</li>
      <li>Vote on how to spend $2 million of the City’s budget to benefit our communities.</li>
    </ol>
  {{/_}}</p>

  <p>{{#_}}As part of this process, residents inform the City about their
  priorities to help decide future budget investments.{{/_}}</p>
