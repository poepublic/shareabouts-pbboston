<h2>{{#_}}Welcome to Participatory Budgeting in Boston!{{/_}}</h2>

<p>{{#_}}Participatory Budgeting (PB) is a democratic process where community
members directly decide how to spend part of a public budget. The goal of
Participatory Budgeting in Boston is to empower residents to elevate community
centered project ideas with an emphasis on social and racial equity. By
engaging in Participatory Budgeting, Bostonians of all ages and backgrounds can
help inform priorities and future investments for the City’s larger budget
process.{{/_}}</p>

<p>{{#_}}<strong>Ideas in Action</strong> is the City's new Participatory
Budgeting initiative, where Bostonians can decide how to spend a part of the
City’s budget. The City of Boston launched the first cycle of Participatory
Budgeting and collected ideas from residents between July 1st to August 15,
2024. Boston residents were asked about how to spend $2 million to benefit
their community.{{/_}}</p>

<p>{{#_}}From August through September 2024, the City will review all submitted
project ideas during the Idea Collection phase. The Office of Participatory
Budgeting will host public workshops in the fall to develop these ideas into
proposals for the PB ballot for voting in January.{{/_}}</p>
