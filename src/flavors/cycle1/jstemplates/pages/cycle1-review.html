<h2>{{#_}}The City of Boston’s First Participatory Budgeting Cycle{{/_}}</h2>

<p>{{#_}}In the summer of 2024, the City of Boston’s Office of Participatory Budgeting (OPB) launched <strong>Ideas in Action</strong>, an initiative where Boston residents decided how to spend $2 million of the City’s budget to benefit their communities. Thousands of residents engaged by joining community meetings, submitting project ideas, drafting the proposals that appeared on the ballot, and collectively voting on the top projects that they wanted to see implemented.{{/_}}</p>
